On-Chain chess
Create a chess game, where a user it automatically matched with another user,
and then each step in the game is recorded on-chain. The chain contract should
not allow invalid chess moves, should automatically choose the winner, and in
case of inaction should make the other player the winner after the certain time
threshold.
